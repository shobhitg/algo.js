This project is about creating a NodeJS module for implementation of various computer science algorithms.

There are three additional area that needs to go on side by side with the development:
* unit tests
* documentation
* benchmarks


## Development

 ### Prerequisites

This project uses some ES2105 constructs and will use whatever the latest version of Nodejs 5 supports.

Therefore, please make sure you have the latest NodeJS version 5.

**To install all dev dependencies**


Call:

```bash
npm install
```

### Unit tests

**To run unit tests**

Call:

```bash
npm test
```

### Documentation

**To generate documentation**

Call:

```bash
npm run jsdoc
```

### Benchmarks

**To run benchmarks**

Currently there is only one benchmark file for sorting.

We can run it directly by calling:

```bash
./benchmarks/sortingBenchmarks.js
```

Eventually when we will have more benchmark files, we will need to have a benchmark driver to run all benchmarks altogether.
